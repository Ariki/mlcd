Yet another PCD8544 display controlling library for AVR microcontrollers

### Features

* Supports monochrome graphic displays based on PCD8544 controller
  (e. g. Nokia 3310/5110 LCD)
* Includes very restricted set of functions necessary for low-level
  display interaction and text output
* Small enough to be used with ATtiny microcontrollers
* Configurable font for text output: several symbol groups you can enable
  separately in compile time
* ASCII and Cyrillic fonts available
* Distributed under the MIT license
